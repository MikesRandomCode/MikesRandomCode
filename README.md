- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MikesRandomCode! I use this GitHub profile to share all the code I used for my varied mathematical experiments I blog about on mikesrandompages.wordpress.com. Feel free to browse around and look at the code if anything interests you. Also, if something fancies you, be sure to look at the accompanying blog post. Maybe you'll learn something!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in probability theory and stochastics. Most of my projects will be stochastic simulations used to answer a random question I had one day.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
